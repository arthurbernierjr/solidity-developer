# Final Project Submission Guidelines - MERN Stack Dapp with Smart Contracts for Cryptocurrency Transfers

## Objective

Create a Decentralized Application (Dapp) using the MERN Stack and Smart Contracts that allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet and send ETH, WETH, USDC, USDT, and DAI to any other wallet on the Ethereum blockchain. The app should also notify users when their transaction has failed or been successful.

## Instructions

1. Develop a Dapp using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and Smart Contracts for handling cryptocurrency transfers.
2. Implement wallet integration, allowing users to connect their Ethereum wallet to the application.
3. Create a user interface that allows users to select the cryptocurrency (ETH, WETH, USDC, USDT, or DAI) they want to send and input the ammount of crypto they want to send to another wallet
4. Use ENS or full public key to choose recipient

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Dapp must allow users to connect their wallet and send Ethereum, WETH, USDC, USDT, and DAI to any other wallet on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. The app should provide real-time notifications for users when their transaction has failed or been successful.
3. The project must utilize the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and include a functional smart contract.
4. The Dapp's code should be well-documented, and the README.md should provide clear instructions on how to run and interact with the Dapp.
5. The Dapp should follow best practices for security, usability, and maintainability.


## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your final project.
2. Push your code to the repository, including the front-end (React), back-end (Express and Node.js), database (MongoDB), smart contract, and any necessary dependencies.
3. Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to run and interact with your Dapp, as well as a brief explanation of its features.
4. In your README.md, also provide an overview of the project's architecture, including the key components and their interactions.
5. Ensure that your code is well-documented, following best practices for readability and maintainability.
