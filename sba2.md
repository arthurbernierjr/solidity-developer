# Skill Based Assessment - Deploying and Managing Dapps and Smart Contracts

## Objective

Assess the learner's ability to deploy, manage, and interact with Dapps and smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

## Instructions

1. Create a Dapp that allows users to create and manage a simple voting system, utilizing a smart contract to store the votes on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Deploy your smart contract on a test network, such as Rinkeby or Ropsten, using a deployment tool, such as Truffle or Remix.
3. Create a front-end interface for your Dapp using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and a library like web3.js to interact with the Ethereum network.
4. Implement a function to allow users to vote for their preferred option and display the current vote counts.
5. Include error handling and validations to ensure that users can only vote once and that their votes are correctly recorded on the blockchain.
6. Submit your assessment via GitHub by creating a new repository and pushing your code. Make sure to include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to run the Dapp and interact with the smart contract.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Dapp must allow users to create and manage a simple voting system.
2. The smart contract must be successfully deployed on a test network.
3. The front-end interface must allow users to vote for their preferred option and display the current vote counts.
4. The Dapp must include error handling and validations to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your assessment.
2. Push your code to the repository, including the smart contract, front-end interface, and any necessary dependencies.
3. Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to run the app, tests and any additional information about your assessment.
4. Submit the link to your GitHub repository to your instructor for review.

**Important Note**: Do not publish any private keys or seed phrases in your GitHub repository. Always ensure that sensitive information is kept secure and private.
