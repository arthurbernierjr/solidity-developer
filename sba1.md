# Skill Based Assessment - Testing Dapps and Smart Contracts

## Objective

Assess the learner's understanding and ability to use testing frameworks and tools for Dapps and smart contracts.

## Instructions

1. Create a new smart contract that performs basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Implement a testing suite using a testing framework, such as Truffle, to write unit tests for each operation of the smart contract.
3. Include both positive and negative test cases, ensuring that the smart contract functions correctly under various conditions and handles errors appropriately.
4. Submit your assessment via GitHub by creating a new repository and pushing your code. Make sure to include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to run the tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The smart contract must correctly perform the arithmetic operations.
2. The testing suite must include unit tests for each operation.
3. The tests must cover both positive and negative test cases.
4. The smart contract must handle errors and edge cases appropriately.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your assessment.
2. Push your code to the repository, including the smart contract, testing suite, and any necessary dependencies.
3. Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to run the tests and any additional information about your assessment.
4. Submit the link to your GitHub repository to your instructor for review.

**Important Note**: Do not publish any private keys or seed phrases in your GitHub repository. Always ensure that sensitive information is kept secure and private.
